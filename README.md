In this project, users have the ability to create new entries in their diary. The application offers several key features, including:

1. Sorting Entries: Users can easily sort their diary entries based on date, either from newest to oldest or from oldest to newest.

2. Pagination: The application presents diary entries in manageable chunks, displaying five entries at a time.

3. Entry Deletion: Deleting diary entries is a straightforward process with the help of a confirmation dialog.
